# Hamiltonian-cycle
Module with functions to create random and deterministic hamiltonian cycle.


### Scripts

**hamiltonian.py**: is the module with the functions to create random and determinit hamiltonian cycle for a regular (square or rectangular) mesh.

  - kurskal: function to construct the minimum spanning tree through kurskal algorithm.
  - make_square_mesh: Function to construct the nodes mesh position.

**exemple.py**: is the script that contain some example about the use of functions from hamiltonian.py
